When finished, this "Multiple Random Number Generator" will generate a positive or negative random number between the minimum and maximum numbers as many times as you want it to.

Concerning Code Line Length: 
I've read that it is recommended for code lines to be no longer than between 80 to 120 characters, but at the moment, I just use "alt z" when working in V.S.C. to just wrap the lines so that I can view the code at whatever resolution, width, especially since I am working on a laptop and viewing two or more things at once on the screen. So if my code-line length bothers you, please take that into consideration. But, I have to admit, toggling word-wrap with "alt z" is kind of growing on me because, in way, I don't have to spend time trying make code lines be constrained to a maximum character length. But if someone hired me and want me to do my best to keep the code line character count to be no longer than 80 to 120 characters long, I would do my best to do that.
