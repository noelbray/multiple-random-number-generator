This branch, mocha-in-browser-automated-testing, was created so that I could try doing some of the things in the Javascript.info's "Automated testing with Mocha
" tutorial to try to learn, practice, do at least a little bit of in-browser automated testing; and to give me more practice using git of which I'm doing my best to get better at using.

This branch will Not be merged into the main branch.

This branch is only for helping me learn and pratice things, and for experimenting.

Thank you for reading this readme.

I hope you have a very great day.

P.S. I would like to get, do some remote coding work for a project or someone soon. I want to at least get my foot in the door. I'm open to doing html, css, and any javascript remote work that you think I would be able to do. So, if you know of a project or someone I could work for that has work that is within my current ability to do, please let me know.
